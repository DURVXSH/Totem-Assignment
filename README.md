## 🏛️ The Three Pillars of Restoration

Inspired by Vedic wisdom, we address the fundamental elements of life through a holistic, action-driven approach:

| Element | Sanskrit Name | Focus Area | Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Air** | **Vayu** | Urban Smog & Air Quality | Restoring the breath of life through scientific & community initiatives. |
| **Water** | **Jal** | River Rejuvenation (Yamuna) | Revivng sacred water bodies through bio-remediation and "Jan Bhagidari". |
| **Land** | **Bhumi** | Herbal Valley & Bio-Economy | Creating a living model of sustainable agriculture and medicinal forests. |
